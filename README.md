# UnitySpriteSwapper

Rough version - if this turns out to be something people find useful, I may polish it up.
Uses OdinInspector, but it isn't required for the functionality, so feel free to strip it out.

KNOWN BUG: The populate function doesn't mark the data as dirty, so it won't save unless you manually change one of the swap sets after populating them.
